## This script takes some of the data from the CDS1/CDS2 Single guide RNA 
## paper and does a mock analysis. Disclaimer it's not inspired by anyone's 
## real analysis!

## I've put together a bit of code few **purposefully** bad practices


## Your task is to fix them.
## You'll need to:
# 1) Correct any paths to relative ones (hint: use `here::here()`)
# 2) Try using pipe operator (`%>%` or |> ) instead of repeatedly assigning variables
# 3) Reorganise the code to read/write files in a more orderly structure
# 4) Capture the environment you used with renv
