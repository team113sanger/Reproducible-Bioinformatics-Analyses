# Docker 101: Managing Scientific Environments with Docker

This tutorial will guide you through creating and extending Docker images for R analysis environments. You'll learn how to capture dependencies and ensure reproducibility across different systems.

## Part 1: Extending a Rocker Image

### Introduction

Docker allows us to create isolated environments with specific software versions. For R users, the `rocker` project provides pre-built images with R and common packages installed.

### The Base Dockerfile

We'll start with a basic Dockerfile that uses the `rocker/tidyverse:4.2.0` image, which comes with R 4.2.0 and the tidyverse packages pre-installed.

You can run this base image with a simple command:

``` bash
docker run -it rocker/tidyverse:4.2.0 R
```

This will start an R session inside a Docker container with the tidyverse packages already available.
You could check this by runnning `library(tidyverse)`


### Creating a Custom Environment

To add more packages to this environment, we can create a Dockerfile that extends the base image:

``` dockerfile
FROM rocker/tidyverse:4.2.0

# Install additional packages from CRAN
RUN install2.r --error \
    rmarkdown \
    shiny \
    knitr
```

### Your Task

Modify the Dockerfile in `exercises/02_exploring_docker/02.1_docker_101_R/Dockerfile` to include three additional R packages:

1.  `cowplot` - A package that helps plotting multi-panel
2.  `ggsci` - Another package that helps plotting scientific figures
3.  `styler` - A package for cleaning up R code

### Building Your Docker Image

Once you've modified the Dockerfile, build your image with:

``` bash
cd exercises/02_exploring_docker/02.1_docker_101_R
docker build -t my-r-environment .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`) and tag it as `my-r-environment`.

### Testing Your Image

To verify that your image was built correctly with all required packages, run:

``` bash
docker run --rm -it my-r-environment R -e "library(glue); library(here); library(yaml); cat('All packages loaded successfully!\n')"
```

This command: - Creates a container from your image - Runs R with the command to load your packages - Removes the container after it finishes (`--rm`) - Uses interactive mode with a terminal (`-it`)

``` dockerfile
FROM rocker/tidyverse:4.2.0

# Install additional packages from CRAN
RUN install2.r --error \
    rmarkdown \
    shiny \
    knitr \
    glue \
    here \
    yaml
```

## Part 2: Recording and Rebuilding Your Environment with renv

Instead of manually specifying packages in a Dockerfile, we can use `renv` to automatically track and restore package dependencies.

### Create an renv Lock File

1.  Open an R session (either in the terminal or in RStudio)
2.  Install some packages with `renv`:

``` r
# Initialize renv for your project
renv::init()

# Install packages
renv::install("glue")
renv::install("here")
renv::install("yaml")

# Create a snapshot of your environment
renv::snapshot()
```

This creates an `renv.lock` file that records all your dependencies with exact versions.

### Building a Docker Image from the Lock File

Navigate to the exercise directory:

``` bash
cd /workspaces/Reproducible-Bioinformatics-Analyses/exercises/02_exploring_docker/02.1_rebuilding_your_R_environment
docker build -t example_renv .
```

The Dockerfile in this directory should be set up to use your `renv.lock` file to rebuild the exact same environment.

### Running Your Environment

``` bash
docker run -it example_renv R
```

This opens an R session with all the packages from your `renv.lock` file pre-installed and ready to use.

## Next Steps

As part of this tutorial I've included a simple dockerfile for building a python or conda environment. Why not try adding in some additional packages and building new environments

For python Try adding as your favourite package and creating a docker environment that contains it

``` bash
cd /workspaces/Reproducible-Bioinformatics-Analyses/exercises/02_exploring_docker/02.2_docker_101_python
docker build -t my-python-env .
```

Run and check it's added with

``` bash
docker run -it my-python-env python3 
```

For conda. Try adding MAGECK as a package and creating a docker environment that contains it

``` bash
cd /workspaces/Reproducible-Bioinformatics-Analyses/exercises/02_exploring_docker/02.2_docker_101_python
docker build -t my-python-env .
```

``` bash
docker run -it my-python-env python3 
```

After completing these exercises, outside this session you might want to consider exploring:

-   Adding Bioconductor packages to your R Docker image
-   Mounting volumes to share data between your host system and the container
-   Pushing your image to Docker Hub or a private registry for sharing
